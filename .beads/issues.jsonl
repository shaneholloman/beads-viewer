Run git log command\n2. Parse output commit by commit\n3. For each commit:\n   a. Parse commit metadata (SHA, timestamp, author, message)\n   b. Parse the diff section\n   c. For each changed line in diff:\n      - Parse old JSON (lines starting with -)\n      - Parse new JSON (lines starting with +)\n      - Detect what changed (new bead, status change, other)\n      - Create BeadEvent records\n4. Return chronologically sorted events\n\n## Diff Parsing Details\n\n### Detecting Bead Creation\n\\`\\`\\`diff\n+{\"id\":\"AUTH-123\",\"title\":\"Fix login\",\"status\":\"open\",...}\n\\`\\`\\`\nA line starting with \\`+\\` containing valid JSON = EventCreated\n\n### Detecting Status Changes\n\\`\\`\\`diff\n-{\"id\":\"AUTH-123\",...,\"status\":\"open\",...}\n+{\"id\":\"AUTH-123\",...,\"status\":\"in_progress\",...}\n\\`\\`\\`\nSame bead ID, different status = appropriate event type\n\n## Edge Cases to Handle\n1. Malformed JSON lines: Skip with warning\n2. Multiple beads changed in one commit: Generate event for each\n3. Empty commits: No events generated\n4.

This enables long-horizon task coordination by providing dashboards for feature areas (feat:auth), work types (fixes, ui), and epic progress tracking.\n\n## Inspiration\nBased on @kraitsura's Labels Viewer concept showing:\n- Label selector with fuzzy search and progress bars\n- Dashboard view grouping by EPICS and LABELS  \n- Completion tracking (X/Y format with visual progress)\n- Dependency depth toggle\n\n## User Stories\n- As a project lead, I want to see progress across feature areas at a glance\n- As a developer, I want to quickly filter to issues with a specific label\n- As a team, we want to track epic completion with roll-up statistics\n- As anyone, I want fuzzy search to find labels quickly\n\n## Key Features\n\n### 1. Label Selector (Overlay)\n- Fuzzy searchable picker accessible via \\`l\\` key from any view\n- Shows all labels and epics with progress bars\n- X/Y format showing completed vs total\n- Checkmarks for 100% complete labels\n\n### 2. Label Dashboard View  \n- Dedicated view showing label statistics\n- Two sections: EPICS (issues with type=epic) and LABELS\n- Progress bars with completion percentages\n- Expandable to drill into issues per label\n- Section cycling: Ready/Blocked/InProgress/Closed\n\n### 3. Dependency Depth Toggle\n- \\`d\\` key cycles through 1/2/3/All depth levels\n- Controls how deeply to show dependency chains\n- Current depth shown in status bar\n\n### 4. Visual Enhancements\n- Distinction between labeled and unlabeled issues\n- Epic progress roll-up from child issues\n- Quick jump from dashboard to filtered list\n\n## Keybindings\n| Key | Action |\n|-----|--------|\n| l | Open label selector (global) |\n| Enter | Select label / Confirm |\n| Esc | Close selector / Back |\n| j/k | Navigate |\n| Tab | Cycle sections |\n| d | Cycle dependency depth |\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] \\`l\\` key opens label selector from any view\n- [ ] Dashboard shows accurate progress for all labels\n- [ ] Fuzzy search finds labels quickly\n- [ ] Epic completion rolls up from children\n- [ ] Dependency depth toggle works smoothly\n\n## Implementation Phases\n1. **Phase 1**: Label statistics extraction and data model\n2. **Phase 2**: Label selector UI with fuzzy search\n3. **Phase 3**: Label dashboard view\n4. **Phase 4**: Integration, depth toggle, polish","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-15T15:48:59.347877-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T15:55:52.993952-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-15T15:55:52.993952-05:00","labels":["epic","feature","tui","labels-view"]}

This is the highest-value feature because it directly answers the question every developer and AI agent asks: 'What can I actually work on right now?'\n\n## Background \u0026 Motivation\nThe analysis package already computes TopologicalOrder via topo.Sort(). However, this raw ordering isn't directly actionable because:\n1. It includes closed issues\n2. It doesn't filter to 'leaf nodes' (tasks with no open blockers)\n3. It's not exposed via CLI for programmatic access\n\n## Value Proposition\n- For Humans: A 'Smart To-Do' view showing only actionable items eliminates cognitive overhead of scanning blocked tasks.\n- For AI Agents: --robot-plan enables autonomous workflows where agents can request a strictly ordered task list, preventing work on blocked items.\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Add GetActionableIssues() to analysis package - returns issues where all blocking dependencies are closed\n2. Add GetExecutionPlan() - returns topologically sorted actionable items with parallel tracks identified\n3. CLI flag --robot-plan outputs JSON with execution order\n4. TUI view showing actionable items grouped by parallel tracks\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Agent can request plan and receive valid execution order\n- Plan respects all blocking dependencies\n- Parallel tracks (independent work streams) are identified\n- Zero actionable items shown when all open issues are blocked","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-26T23:35:42.137355284Z","updated_at":"2025-11-27T01:09:04.691007979Z","closed_at":"2025-11-27T01:09:04.691007979Z","labels":["ai-agent","builds-on-existing","high-value"]}
